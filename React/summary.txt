/*------------------------------------------------------------------------REACT------------------------------------------------------------*/

Defination:- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used to build single-page applications. React allows us to create reusable components.
             React is a maintained by Facebook and a large community of developers.


Key Features:- 

1) Declarative: React allows developers to describe the desired UI state, and React takes care of updating the DOM to match that state.
2) Component-Based: React applications are built using reusable components, which encapsulate their own logic and rendering.
3) Efficient: React uses a virtual DOM to minimize direct manipulation of the real DOM, resulting in improved performance.
4) Learn Once, Write Anywhere: React can be used to build web applications, mobile apps[with React Native], and even desktop appplications.
5) JSX: React uses JSX, a syntax extension to Javascript, to describe the structure of UI components.


How Does React Work?

React created a Virtual DOM in memory

Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React created a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.

React only changes what needs to be changed!

React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changes.


/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------What is JSX--------------------------------------------------------*/

JSX stands for Javascript XML, it allows us to write HTML in React. It makes easier to write and add HTML in React.

Coding JSX 

JSX allows us to write HTML elements in Javascript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods. JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.
Here are two examples:-

Ex1

const myElement = <h1>I Love JSX!</h1>;
createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
    myElement
);

Ex2

const myElement = React.createElement('h1',{},'I do not use JSX!');
createRoot(document.getElementById('root)).render(
    myElement
);

As we can see in the first example, JSX allows us to write HTML directly within the JavaScript code.
JSX is an extension of the JavaScript language based on ES6, and is translated into regular JavaScript at runtime.


/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Components in React-----------------------------------------------------------*/

Components are the building blocks of React applications. They are reusable, self-contained units that manage their own state and render a specific part of the UI. React components can be either functional components or class components.

Functional components are simple JavaScript functions that accept props as arguments and return JSX.

function Welcome(props){
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

Class Components

Class components are ES6 classes that extend the React.Component class. They have a render() method that returns JSX can manage their own state using this.state

class Welcome extends React.Component {
    render(){
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>
    }
}


/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ways To Use/Create React------------------------------------------------------*/

1. Using Create React App (CRA)

1) Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.
   It is an official tool provided by Facebook to quickly set up a React project without manual configuration.
   It automatically sets up Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other build tools.

Steps:

1) Install CRA globally or use npx:

npx create-react-app my-app

2) Navigate to the project:

cd my-app

3) Start the development server:

npm start


Features of CRA:

1) Pre-configured Webpack and Babel setup.
2) Provides development and production build scripts.
3) Supports JSX,ES6+, and environment variables.
4) Automatically creates a Single Page Application(SPA) structure.



2. Using Vite for React

Vite is a modern, fast build tool that provides instant server startup and lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement(HMR).
It uses ESBuild for bundling during development and Rollup for production.


Steps:

1) Create a new React project:

npm create vite@latest my-vite-app

2) Choose React or React + TypeScript template.

Navigate to the folder:

cd my-vite-app

3) Install dependencies:

npm install

4) Start the development server:

npm run dev

Features of Vite:

1) Much faster development build times than CRA.
2) Uses ES modules natively.
3) Easier to configure and supports modern JavaScript features.


/*-----------------------------------------Babel-------------------------------------------*/
Babel:-  Babel is a JavaScript compiler used in both CRA and Vite to:
Convert JSX into standard JavaScript that browsers can understand.
Transpile modern ES6+ syntax into backward-compatible JavaScript for older browsers.
Enable use of React features like hooks and components seamlessly.

For example:

const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;

Babel converts this JSX into:

const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, React!");


/*-----------------------------------------SPA (Single-page application)----------------------------------------------------------------*/

An SPA (Single-page application) is a web app implementation that loads only a single web document, and then updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript APIs such as Fetch when different content is to be shown
This therefore allows users to use websites without loading whole new pages from the server, which can result in performance gains and a more dynamic experience, with some tradeoff disadvantages such as SEO, more effort required to maintain state,
implement navigation, and do meaningful performance monitoring.

Key Characteristics:

1)Uses React Router for client-side navigation.
2)Fast and smooth transitions between pages.
3)Reduces server requests since most rendering happens on the client side.


Example:-

import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

/*--------------------------------------Difference Between CRA and via Vite--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

When you build any React app:

1. There's on HTML file(with a <div id="root"></div>).
2. React code(written in js) runs inside that <div>.
3. React shows your components (like buttons, text, etc.) on the web page.
4. Whenever data or state changes, React updates only the part of the screen that changed(not the whole page).

That's called rendering(showing data) and re-rendering(updating when data changes).

1) Using CRA

1. CRA uses a tool called Webpack behind the scenes.
2. Webpack takes all your React files(JS,CSS,images) and bundles them into one big file.
3. That big file is then added into the HTML page (index.html inside public folder).
4. The browser loads that bundle, and React code, Webpack:
    * Rebuilds that bundle.
    * Sends it again to your browser.
    * Your page reloads (or partially updates).


This process takes time, especially when the project gets bigger — because Webpack keeps rebuilding the whole bundle.


Example in CRA
---------------

When you change text inside App.js:

<h1>Hello World!</h1>

to:-
<h1>Hello React!</h1>


1) CRA rebuilds your files.
2) Reloads the browser (sometimes refreshes completely).
3) Then shows the new text.

That’s how data gets re-rendered and the page reloads.


2) Using Vite

1. Vite doesn't bundle everything at once like CRA.
2. It gives your file directly to the browser using a modern system called ES Modules.
3. The browser loads only what it needs -- instantly.
4. When you make a small change in your code, Vite:
  * Detects the change.
  * Sends only that changed part to the browser.
  * React updates the screen immeediately without reloading the whole page.

This is called HMR(Hot Module Replacement) -- it's like updating one piece of puzzle instead of remaking the whole puzzle again.

Example 
----------

If you change:

<h1>Hello World!</h1>

to:-

<h1>Hello React!</h1>

Vite:

1) Instantly sends only that small change to the browser.
2) The page updates immeediately, without reloading.
3) Your text appears changes almost instantly.




1)In CRA, every time you change one word, React rewrites the whole notebook before showing you again.
2)In Vite, if you change one word, React only updates that single line instantly — the rest stays untouched.
