Defination:- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used to build single-page applications. React allows us to create reusable components.
             React is a maintained by Facebook and a large community of developers.


Key Features:- 

1) Declarative: React allows developers to describe the desired UI state, and React takes care of updating the DOM to match that state.
2) Component-Based: React applications are built using reusable components, which encapsulate their own logic and rendering.
3) Efficient: React uses a virtual DOM to minimize direct manipulation of the real DOM, resulting in improved performance.
4) Learn Once, Write Anywhere: React can be used to build web applications, mobile apps[with React Native], and even desktop appplications.
5) JSX: React uses JSX, a syntax extension to Javascript, to describe the structure of UI components.


How Does React Work?

React created a Virtual DOM in memory

Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React created a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.

React only changes what needs to be changed!

React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changes.


What is JSX

JSX stands for Javascript XML, it allows us to write HTML in React. It makes easier to write and add HTML in React.

Coding JSX 

JSX allows us to write HTML elements in Javascript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods. JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.
Here are two examples:-

Ex1

const myElement = <h1>I Love JSX!</h1>;
createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
    myElement
);

Ex2

const myElement = React.createElement('h1',{},'I do not use JSX!');
createRoot(document.getElementById('root)).render(
    myElement
);

As we can see in the first example, JSX allows us to write HTML directly within the JavaScript code.
JSX is an extension of the JavaScript language based on ES6, and is translated into regular JavaScript at runtime.


Components in React

Components are the building blocks of React applications. They are reusable, self-contained units that manage their own state and render a specific part of the UI. React components can be either functional components or class components.

Functional components are simple JavaScript functions that accept props as arguments and return JSX.

function Welcome(props){
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

Class Components

Class components are ES6 classes that extend the React.Component class. They have a render() method that returns JSX can manage their own state using this.state

class Welcome extends React.Component {
    render(){
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>
    }
}
