✅ Summary of Props in React
1. What are Props?

Props (short for properties) are like function arguments in JavaScript.
They allow you to send data from a parent component to a child component.

✅ 2. Why do we use Props?

(1)To reuse components with different data.
(2)To keep components dynamic and flexible.
(3)To separate UI structure (component) from data (props).

✅ 3. How Props Work

Props work in one direction only → from parent to child (called one-way data flow).

✅ 4. Sending Props (Parent Component)

<DisplayData languagesArray={techs} />

Here,

languagesArray is the prop name

techs is the value you are sending

✅ 5. Receiving Props (Child Component)
const DisplayData = (props) => {
  console.log(props.languagesArray)
}


You receive everything inside a single object called props.

✅ 6. Using Destructuring (Better Way)
const DisplayData = ({ languagesArray }) => {
  console.log(languagesArray)
}


This makes the code clean and readable.

✅ 7. Props Are Read-Only

You cannot change props inside the child component.
They are fixed after being passed from the parent.

⭐ Example to Understand Easily
function Parent() {
  return <Child name="Saniya" age={21} />;
}

function Child(props) {
  return <p>{props.name} is {props.age} years old.</p>;
}


Parent sends → Child receives → Child displays.
