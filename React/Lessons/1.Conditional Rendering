/*------------------------------------Conditional Rendering-------------------------------------------------*/

Defination: Conditional rendering means showing different UI depending on conditions.
            React lets you use Javascript logic(if, else, &&, ? :) directly inside JSX.
            But to understand conditional rendering deeply, you must know about state variables and hooks.

1) Why is State Needed in Conditional Rendering?

Conditional rendering always depends on changing data.
Example Conditions:
1) User is logged in
2) dark mode is ON
3) cart items > 0
4) form is submitted
5) API is loading

These values changes over time, so you don't store them in normal variables.
A normal variable DOES Not update the screen automatically. A state variable does this.

Example:

let isLoggedIn = false; // UI will not update


2) What are state variables ?

State variables are special variables that React watches. When they change , react rerenders the component.

ex:
1)First, import useState from React
2)Now you can declare a state variable inside your component


const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(false);

You'll get two things from useState: the current state(count), and the function that lets you update it.
You can give any names, but the convention is to write [something,setSomething].

setIsLoggedIn(true); // React automatically updates the UI.


3) What Are Hooks? Why they are used/needed?

Functions starting with use are called Hooks.
Hooks are special React functions that let you use React features.

For conditional rendering, the main hook is:

useState → store values that control the UI

useEffect → run logic that may change conditions (like fetching data, timers)

Without hooks, you cannot make the UI update based on conditions.
