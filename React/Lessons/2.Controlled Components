/*--------------------------------------Controlled Components---------------------------------------------*/

Defination: Controlled Components are form elements (input, textares, select) whose value is controlled by react state instead of the browser.

1. Why Do we need State in Forms?

Form values change with every keystroke.
To make React understand what the user typed, we must store the value in state variables.

Example:

1) user types name
2) React stores it in state
3) UI updates
4) validation becomes easier
5) submit button can be disabled/enabled

Without state variables, React cannot track what is inside the input.

2.What Exactly Are Controlled Components?

A component is "controlled" when:
. The value of the form element comes from state
. The onChange event updates the state

Example:

<input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />

React becomes the single source of truth.

3. Why Are Hooks Needed?

Hooks are needed for two main reasons:

1) Storing the input value

useState() stores the input data.

const [name, setName] = useState("");

2) Running logic when values change

useEffect() can be used to perform validation or auto-save when input changes.

useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Name changed:", name);
}, [name]);

Without hooks:

. you can't manage dynamic form behaviour
. you can't validate inputs
. you can't update UI based on what user types


4. Controlled Component examples

(A) Controlled input

<input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />

(B) Controlled Textarea

<textarea value={bio} onChange={(e) => setBio(e.target.value)} />

(C) Controlled Select
<select value={city} onChange={(e) => setCity(e.target.value)}>
  <option>Mumbai</option>
  <option>Delhi</option>
</select>

(D) Controlled Checkbox
<input 
  type="checkbox"
  checked={agree}
  onChange={(e) => setAgree(e.target.checked)}
/>


5. Multiple Inputs With One State Object
const [form, setForm] = useState({ name: "", email: "" });

function handleChange(e) {
  setForm({
    ...form,
    [e.target.name]: e.target.value
  });
}


6. Why Are Controlled Components Important?

Because they give:

1) real-time validation
2) instant feedback 
3) conditional submit buttons
4) dynamic errors
5) controlled behaviour
6) synchronized UI and data

React stays in full control


| Controlled             | Uncontrolled                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| React manages value    | Browser manages value        |
| Uses `useState`        | Uses `useRef`                |
| Best for dynamic forms | Best for simple, small forms |


Controlled Components

(1) Controlled components use state variables for form values.
(2) State updates through hooks (useState) on every change.
(3) This makes validation, dynamic UI, and form handling easy.
(4) Hooks like useEffect can perform actions whenever values change.
(5) Without hooks/state, React cannot manage form data.
